      "graduation_report": "<h3>Test Pilot No More 404s Graduation Report</h3> <p>Last winter, some folks from the Test Pilot team got together with some folks from the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Archive</a> and hatched a plan. On the Test Pilot side of things, we were busy building our platform and getting experiments out into the wild. Meanwhile, the team at the Internet Archive was prototyping an add-on to help users avoid dead ends on the Web by checking if they had archived versions of sites available in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/web/\" target=\"_blank\">Wayback Machine</a> for users who encountered 404 errors.</p> <p>We launched the No More 404s experiment with a few goals in mind. We know from user research that 404 pages are a persistent nuisance on the Web, and a No More 404s add-on seemed like a really sweet utility to help steer users toward their intended content. Additionally, the Test Pilot team wanted to find out how a partner organization like the Internet Archive could help bring testable features into Firefox.</p> <p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p> <p>When we launched No More 404s, the user interface was simple and unobtrusive. If a participant visited a 404 on the Web – specifically if a site that returned a HTTP header code 404 – the No More 404s experiment would send a request to the Wayback Machine to see if the service had an archived version of the page. If one existed, No More 404s would drop a notification bar on the page with a link to it. Users could then visit the content archived in the Wayback Machine, dismiss the notification bar, or just continue browsing as usual.</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/experiments_experimentdetail/2/4/24ddd4335aca6b96cca9106a6f3411d2_image_1470245154_0440.77da0f12.jpg\">\n  <figcaption>We launched No More 404s with a restrained design.</figcaption>\n</figure> <p>Later on in the experiment we made a few changes to the add-on. First, we added in more common error codes associated with missing Web assets. Then we made a much larger change when we asked our design team to increase the visibility of the add-on. We wanted to see how these changes would affect user perception of the experiment.</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/graduation/design-update.fc8a83ee.png\" />\n  <figcaption>In December we changed to something a bit crazier.</figcaption>\n</figure> <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p> <p>Both teams wanted to get a sense of how many of the URLs that display 404 errors today had pages archived in the Wayback Machine. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p2cZFy5DiM0JAFhp4lIisLtTeu4Y3fIusQLE9obOx5s/edit#gid=287298530\" target=\"_blank\">We tracked total 404s</a> encountered by Test Pilot participants (1,275,165) as well as results returned by the Archive (185,081). Over the course of the experiment, we averaged a result 14.5 percent of the time, but also observed that over the course of the experiment the daily average rose.</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/graduation/gr-001.261c045e.png\" />\n  <figcaption>Both the total 404s encountered and the percentage of returned codes grew over the course of the experiment.</figcaption>\n</figure> <p>In addition to 404s, which are common on the Web, there are other error codes users encounter. For example, users may reach a page with a 408 error code when a server takes too long to respond. In early November, the Internet Archive team decided to <a href=\"https://github.com/internetarchive/FirefoxNoMore404s/blob/master/src/scripts/background.js#L28\" target=\"_blank\">add more error codes to the experiment</a>. We hypothesized that adding additional error codes would cause the overall percentage of sites returned by the Wayback Machine to drop relative to total queries made by the experiment. However, the opposite was true: in the graph above there is a modest uptick in the percentage of valid returns in early November after we made the change.</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/graduation/car.70e92bc6.gif\" />\n  <figcaption>Just look at this guy!</figcaption>\n</figure> <p>In early December we updated the user interface for the experiment and featured an adorable animated GIF. Changing the user interface affected how participants interacted with the No More 404s experiment. Prior to the changes, the experiment was tucked out of the way, so we wanted to see what happened if we made it more flashy. We assumed users might dismiss the UI more frequently than before, and they did, but we were surprised to see that the rate at which users dismissed the pop-up increased sixfold.</p> <p>We also observed an uptick in the percentage of returned results that correlates to these UI changes. Of course, correlation is not causation, and this uptick remains a mystery: changing UI should not have affected the relative rate of successful returns from the Wayback Machine.</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/graduation/gr-002.eeb1ed83.png\" />\n  <figcaption>The rate at which users ignored the interface shot up after we changed the user interface.</figcaption>\n</figure> <p>We also wanted to know how often experimenters encountered 404 errors as they browse. While this experiment did not track total sites visited by our users (because of privacy concerns), we did keep tabs on how many times each browser hit a 404 each week. Throughout the life of the experiment, roughly 50 percent of participants encountered at least one 404 per week. Of those who encountered 404s, well over 25 percent did so at a rate of four or more a week!</p> <figure>  <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/no-more-404s/graduation/gr-003.046ae9f5.png\" />\n  <figcaption> Breakdown of the number of 404s encountered by users each week.</figcaption>\n</figure> <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p> <p>While we’re graduating No More 404s from Test Pilot, and will be moving the add-on to the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Add-ons</a> store so it’s accessible to all Firefox users. We won’t remove it from users who have it installed. If you currently have the add-on installed, you don’t need to do anything. The add-on will continue to update as usual. The Internet Archive team will also be adding some new features so users can add content to the Wayback Machine directly through the add-on! On the Firefox side, we will promote No More 404s on the homepage of the browser.</p> <p>Once the add-on is in its permanent home, our teams will continue to work together on studies that answer key questions, including:</p> <ul>  <li>Do average Firefox users see value in the add-on? </li>\n  <li>Are there ways we could use the Wayback Machine to retrieve content when a user enters a URL for which there is no current DNS record?</li>\n  <li>Could we integrate the Wayback Machine with other tools for archiving Web content, like the Page Shot experiment that is currently part of Test Pilot?</li>\n</ul> <p>In addition to the next steps we’ll be taking in Firefox, the Internet Archive Team recently shipped a version of the add-on for <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a> and Safari support is on the way! The new add-on adds some features that let users save pages directly to the Archive so that the community can contribute directly to the health and growth of the archive.</p> <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed No More 404s, used it, and told us what they thought! We are grateful for your participation.</p> <p>Want to try a new experiment?

      "graduation_report": "<h3>Test Pilot Tracking Protection Graduation Report</h3> <p>The Tracking Protection feature in Private Browsing Mode is popular with Firefox users, but it comes with a few downsides: it can break page layout and multimedia content on websites, and it sometimes blocks content that isn’t tracking you. We’ve collected qualitative evidence of this through user feedback, but since we introduced Tracking Protection, we haven’t been able to quantify the impact of breakage and false positives on the overall user experience.</p> <p>We launched the Tracking Protection experiment in Test Pilot with a goal of understanding how the block list we use for Tracking Protection in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history\">Private Browsing Mode</a> and in\n <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337?mt=8\">Firefox Focus for iOS</a>\n contributes to website breakage. The experiment was fairly\n simple by design: we enabled Tracking Protection and let users disable it on specific sites\n or provide reports about websites that seemed to break as a result of the experiment.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p> <p>The user interface for the Tracking Protection experiment was simple. When Tracking Protection was enabled, users saw an icon in their browser’s URL bar. Clicking the icon opened a panel where participants could report a problem and turn Tracking Protection off for that domain.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/experiments_experimentdetail/detail1.9be143a5.jpg\" alt=\"Tracking Protection doorhanger\" /> </figure> <p>Participants had the option to give more details about the problems they saw.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/experiments_experimentdetail/detail2.a92222a1.jpg\" alt=\"Tracking Protection doorhanger\" /> </figure> <p>For this experiment, we only collected data when participants turned Tracking Protection on or off, or when they reported problems with a particular domain. We did not collect data on other browsing activity and we did not record full URLs.</p> <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p> <p>We hypothesized that users would frequently disable Tracking Protection on broken sites. This, it turns out, was not the case. The chart below shows that despite a high number of participants using Firefox Tracking Protection every day, Tracking Protection was disabled on very few sites.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/graduation/gr-001.f5052a6b.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" /> <figcaption>The number of times users disabled Tracking Protection was low to begin with,  and decreased over the life of the experiment.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Further, the rate at which users disabled Tracking Protection decreased as the experiment progressed. We think that once users disabled Tracking Protection for the most problematic sites, they didn’t encounter or weren’t bothered by breakage to the point that they would disable it for additional sites they visited later in the experiment.  Since we didn’t measure total page views, there are limits to what we can conclude about the number of sites broken by Tracking protection. Nevertheless, this data suggests that breakage may be less widespread than we initially believed, and it’s worth digging deeper into more specific breakage data.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/graduation/gr-002.136e0495.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" /> <figcaption>Disables, enables, reports of breakage, and reports of no breakage over the life of the experiment.</figcaption> </figure> <p>We were also interested in the impact Google Analytics had on site breakage. Google Analytics is a nearly ubiquitous service across the Web (full disclosure:  we use it to gather traffic data for testpilot.firefox.com) that is blocked by\nTracking Protection. When we began this experiment, some developers suggested that how a site set up Google Analytics could have a large impact on breakage. Blocking Google Analytics shouldn’t cause sites to break, but sometimes site developers write code that ignores the possibility of Google Analytics being blocked. If developers don’t accommodate for this possibility, broader failures in the way that code running on sites can occur because scripts on the site make reference to code that is never loaded.</p> <p>It turns out that for the most part Google Analytics does not correlate to breakage. In fact, while Google Analytics shows up frequently in our data, it only correlated to breakage reports 25 percent of the time, which is low compared to breakage rates reported for other trackers.</p> <p>Early on, we noticed that one service – Twimg, Twitter’s remote image hosting service – consistently showed up as a source of reported breakage. By diving into our user feedback, we figured out that this breakage caused images not to render and often lead to broken layout. We communicated our findings to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://disconnect.me/\">Disconnect</a> (the tracking  protection company that provides our block list), and they were able to re-categorize the\nTwimg domain as a content provider, mitigating the breakage.</p> <p>In other cases when a known tracker caused site breakages, were less successful in modifying the Tracking Protection experiment to improve user experience. For example, we saw many reports of breakage linking video playback issues to Tealium, a tracker that’s used for marketing analytics. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/blok/issues/216#issuecomment-266802796\">We attempted to create a work around for this breakage</a> by using something called a shim – a fake initial reference to the tracker code that would theoretically let sites continue to run as though it really existed without breaking. Unfortunately, we found that while we could resolve the initial error by faking references with a code shim, secondary errors would crop as sites tried to execute code. Since these errors tended to be unique across different sites, we determined our approach couldn’t account for every error and wouldn’t scale effectively.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/tracking-protection/graduation/gr-003.22ca224c.png\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" /> <figcaption>Google Analytics is ubiquitous, but shows relative low reported correlated breakage. Meanwhile Twitter’s image service (pbs.twimg.com) is much smaller but shows much higher reported breakage. Tealium (tags.tiqcdn.com) was also a commonly reported source of breakage.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p> <p>What’s next for the Tracking Protection experiment? Now that we’ve announced retirement plans for this add-on, we will no longer maintain it. If you have it enabled, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll automatically uninstall it in the coming days. Tracking Protection will continue as a feature of Private Browsing, however.</p> <p>The Tracking Protection reporting feature, unlike many Test Pilot experiments, was never designed to graduate into Firefox. We created this experiment to learn how Tracking Protection works in the wild. We also learned a lot about (and are  grateful for!) the willingness of our Test Pilot community to provide feedback.</p>\n<p>We intend to run more studies based on our initial results. We are launching a similarly structured study in Test Pilot to learn about site performance in Firefox. We’ll use similar feedback mechanisms as the Tracking Protection study to learn about sites that cause Firefox users particular problems so we can address these issues as we work on our next generation Web rendering engine. Look for this study in late February 2017.</p> <p>We will also conduct some messaging studies to help us understand how Firefox users who aren’t in Test Pilot think about online tracking and how we can best explain the costs and benefits of Tracking Protection and similar blocking services.</p> <p>Finally, we’re planning a follow-up Tracking Protection Study in Test Pilot based on what we learned this go round. In the next round, we will be adding more fine tuned user control, differential privacy, and an improved user interface. We believe these additions will help us take the next step toward shipping Tracking Protection in Firefox beyond Private Browsing Mode. Look for that study in late 2017.</p> <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed Tracking Protection and reported problems through the add-on!</p> <p>Want to try a new experiment?

      "graduation_report": "<h3>Test Pilot Universal Search Retirement Report</h3> <p>Universal Search launched with Test Pilot in May 2016 and is the first experiment we’ve formally retired. We designed it to get you to the best things on the Web faster, by adding search suggestions and site recommendations into Awesome Bar results. We think it did that. We also learned a lot in the process. That’s why we’re calling Universal Search a success.</p> <p>Our basic question was “Would Firefox users find enough value in the recommended sites to click on them in the Awesome Bar?” and we tested this and gathered feedback in a few ways during the course of the experiment.</p> <p><strong>Here’s how it went down</strong></p> <p>At launch, we showed participants two types of recommendations based on their queries: top-level domains (such as Facebook.com, Amazon.com, Youtube.com, etc), and Wikipedia article pages.</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/experiments_experimentdetail/6/d/6d0ff50eff9223f0d0cc58c5aa5d0c81_image_1462827811_0995.2389d5e5.jpg\" alt=\"universal search preview\" /> <figcaption>Result displaying top-level domain.</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/experiments_experimentdetail/8/6/8675c7bf31054abdaf58b47850a1365d_image_1462827811_0451.9d3e091f.jpg\" alt=\"universal search preview\" /> <figcaption>Result displaying Wikipedia article.</figcaption> </figure> <p>For the first two months, we showed recommendations when we thought they would be relevant, about 20 percent of the time. During this period, we saw that participants clicked on a displayed result about 10 percent of the time (we call this a click-thru rate, or CTR).</p> <p>In July, we changed the experiment so that we didn’t display a recommendation if the site was already in a participant’s browsing history.  We expected this to dramatically reduce the frequency of results shown, and it did. Results displayed fell from 20 percent to 7 percent. We were surprised to see that our CTR fell, too.  From this, we hypothesized that duplicates we removed included many sites that users visit habitually, so our initial CTR included many clicks “stolen” from history navigation.</p> <p>In October 2016, we added a third result type, rich movie cards. We predicted these would have a higher CTR than the other types, but discovered that while rich movie cards outperformed Wikipedia, they did not outperform top-level domains.</p> <p><strong>Here’s what we learned</strong></p> <p>When we evaluate an experiment we look at usage data as well as what participants tell us in post-experiment surveys. By both measures, Universal Search was a success. In fact, it outperformed our expectations. We had surprisingly high CTR for showing only three result types and overall user sentiment was quite positive.</p> <p><strong>Results from telemetry data</strong></p> <p>The data showed a final average CTR of 7 percent, and indicated a clear preference for top-level domain results. A breakdown of clicks by result type showed that Wikipedia pages were shown most and clicked least. Top-level domains were the most consistent performer: our better relevancy on top-level domains (even after de-duping) probably indicated we were short-cutting users to sites they already knew they wanted to visit. Movie Cards had the least amount of test data, but outperformed Wikipedia pages.</p> <p>Search Results Displayed and Clicked</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1.c9f9118a.png\" alt=\"Search Results Displayed and Clicked\" /> <figcaption> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1_key1.575c4bff.png\" alt=\"Displayed\" /> Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph1_key2.1b8cb70c.png\" alt=\"Clicked\" /> Clicked<br /><br /> User data showing percentage of time recommendations were displayed and percentage of time participants clicked on recommendations. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Key events to note in the graph</p> <ul><li>May to July -  Top-level domain and Wikipedia results displayed </li> <li>Mid-July to Mid-August - No data collected during telemetry system upgrade</li> <li>Mid-August to September - Top-level domain (de-duped) and Wikipedia results displayed</li> <li>October to November - Rich movie card, top-level domain (de-duped) and Wikipedia results displayed</li></ul> <p>Weekly Performance by Result Type</p> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2.7dbc7632.png\" alt=\"Weekly Performance by Result Type\" /> <figcaption> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key1.77d03538.png\" alt=\"Top-Level Domains: Displayed\" /> Top-Level Domains: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key2.2106a2cf.png\" alt=\"Top-Level Domains: Clicked\" /> Top-Level Domains: Clicked<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key3.0119b83f.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia: Displayed\" /> Wikipedia: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key4.ad3b10c1.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia: Clicked\" /> Wikipedia: Clicked<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key5.d5bec118.png\" alt=\"Movie Cards: Displayed\" /> Movie Cards: Displayed<br /> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph2_key6.56018cc1.png\" alt=\"Movie Cards: Clicked\" /> Movie Cards: Clicked<br /><br /> Percentage of results displayed and clicked by type. </figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Results from participant feedback</strong></p> <p>The great thing about collecting feedback from participants is that we can learn as much from our failures as our successes, and even a successful experiment is not successful for everyone.</p> <p>Some participants who left the experiment in the first weeks mentioned performance issues. Others told us they preferred separate search and Awesome Bars: their learned habits were hard to overcome. Many who left also cited poor result quality: search isn’t easy to get right, especially with a limited data set.</p> <p>However, some of the most telling, representative survey feedback came from users who stayed. Universal Search had a high retention rate, and of the users who remained:</p> <ul><li>65% agreed that Universal Search results were meaningful, and</li> <li>60% agreed that Universal Search helped them complete tasks faster.</li></ul> <figure> <img src=\"/static/images/experiments/universal-search/graduation/graph3.225bd574.png\" alt=\"Results from participant feedback\" /> <figcaption>Participant feedback survey results.</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Here’s what happens next</strong></p> <p>What’s next for Universal Search? Now that we’ve announced retirement plans for this add-on, we will no longer maintain it.  If you have Universal Search enabled, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll automatically uninstall it in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The experiment we built was not a complete product experience, but it was enough to meet our learning goals. If we tried a similar experiment again, we’d pursue better result relevancy and more diverse result types. We would also likely test alternate UX treatments to see if we could affect interaction with results, or improve user acceptance of the combined Awesome Bar for those users who preferred separate URL and search bars. These are questions we may examine in future experiments.</p> <p>Thank you to all the Test Pilots who installed Universal Search, used it, and told us what they thought!  We are grateful for your participation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/mozilla-tech/universal-search-retrospective-b39e1be5d128\" target=\"_blank\">Read additional Universal Search analysis from Chuck Harmston</a>.</p> <p>Want to try a new experiment?
